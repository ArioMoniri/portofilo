        JARVIS here. I must say, your discovery of this Easter Egg is most impressive. Dr. Moniri was quite confident that only individuals of exceptional intellect would uncover this hidden gem.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8">
        As a reward for your astute exploration, Dr. Moniri suggests indulging in an auditory experience that he finds particularly invigorating. May I present to you "Feeling Good" by Michael Bubl√©?

        This track, much like your discovery, exemplifies excellence. Enjoy the melodious journey, and remember: in Dr. Moniri's world, every interaction is an opportunity for brilliance.
